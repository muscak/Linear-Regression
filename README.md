# Linear Regression

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression*.

The purpose of this study is to learn about simple and multiple linear regression using Stats Model package. It's mainly based on the data and code of "The Data Science Course 2022: Complete Data Science Bootcamp" in Udemy.
